# First Capstone Project - Yoga Website
### *Hyperion Development Immersive Web Development and Software Engineering Bootcamp*
This is the first website I developed as part of the Hyperion Development bootcamp. Many of the features of the website were included based on the project requirements set as part of the bootcamp.
The site contains four pages:
* A simple landing / welcome page with a dropdown menu
* An "intro" page which contains some information and photos about yoga (taken from Wikipedia)
* A "connect" page with forms to subscribe to a newsletter or send a "contact us" message"
* A "saved items" page where the user can view information or pictures earmarked from the "intro" page. This page also allows the user to enter and save notes.

The site saves items/notes to "localStorage", and retrieves them from there to display them, which means
saved items/notes can be accessed after a session has been closed and re-opened.
