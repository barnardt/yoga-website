## First Website - Yoga
This is the first website I developed as part of the Hyperion Development bootcamp. Many of the features of the website were included based on the project requirements set as part of the bootcamp.
The site contains four pages:
* A simple landing / welcome page with a dropdown menu
* An "intro" page which contains some information and photos about yoga (taken from Wikipedia). Users can "like" items or pin them to view them individually on the "saved items" page.
* A "connect" page with forms to subscribe to a newsletter or send a "contact us" message
* A "saved items" page where the user can view information or pictures earmarked from the "intro" page. This page also allows the user to enter and save notes.

This website demonstrates the following skills:
* HTML, CSS, and SASS
* Using and customising Bootstrap 4, including using Bootstrap SASS variables
* Mobile friendly design
* Using JavaScript for interactive features
* Using JSON and browser localStorage to read and write from files
* Animations using jQuery
